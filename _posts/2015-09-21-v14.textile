Some new things in v14:

* New, mobile friendly, layout. Includes the ability to rotate using touch, no pinch zoom yet though.
* 2's are now held. You can make them active by putting an A after the toss, so "42A3" would be 423 with an active 2.
* Added a feature to show the orbit/path of each prop.
* Fixed some issues with empty hand path and rotation.

Should put some example GIF's here at some point...
