Reached a good stopping point for v2.0 faster than I expected. I added the following:

* User inputs for beat duration, dwell duration, prop radius and prop coefficient of restitution (ie. bounciness)
* Support for bounce juggling
** Add any number of "B" characters to a single toss to make it a bounce (the number of bounces is the number of B's). Must follow each B with an L (lift), F (force), HL (hyperlift) or HF (hyperforce). So 5 ball lift bounce pattern would be "5BL"
** http://jugglinglab.sourceforge.net/html/ssnotation.html explains the bounce notation I used
* Animated jugglers
* First person camera option
* User input for animation speed

Priorities for the next version:

* Synchronous siteswap "halving" issue
* Alternative dwell paths like reverse cascade, windmill and mills mess
* Alternative props like clubs and rings
Soon I'd like to write a post about my dwell path and flight path interpolation algorithms. Definitely needs explaining because the code is starting to look a little messy.
