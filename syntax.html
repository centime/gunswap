<code>siteswap</code> - siteswap string. Supports standard vanilla like <code>531</code>, multiplex like <code>33[33]</code>, and synchronous like <code>(4,6x)(6x,4)</code>. Passing patterns wrap each beat in &lt;&gt; with each juggler pipe delimited, so <code>&lt;3|3&gt;</code> is two jugglers both running 3 ball cascade. Use P to indicate a pass, so<code>&lt;3P|3P&gt;</code> is a pass on every throw. For multiple jugglers include the index of the juggler who is the target of the pass (starting at 1), so <code>&lt;3P3|3|3P1&gt;</code> is two jugglers passing while a third runs 3 ball cascade. Modify the number of spins with S, so <code>3S03S2</code> is alternating flats and triples. Modify the dwell ratio with D, so <code>3D{.2}3D{.8}</code> is a 3 ball pattern where one hand is rushing the throw (good for animating half shower patterns). Modify the catch and throw by using C and T, respectively, so <code>3C{P}T{C}</code> is penguin (P) catches followed by claw (C) throws. Bounce using B and optionally specify the bounce type (defaults to lift). So <code>5B</code> is a 5 ball lift bounce and <code>5B{HL}</code> is a 5 ball hyperlift bounce (ie. the ball is traveling down when it is caught). Options are L for lift, HL for hyperlift, F for force, and HF for hyperforce.

<code>beatDuration</code> - beat duration in seconds.
